Always create 12/10 best code, especially in behaviour or structure. Don't pile up shit and leave it to your fellow programmers or they could turn out cray-cray and loose all their hair because of you.

I make my code work on EVERY machine, and not only mine, for each release. The code must work after each release and not break anything that was previously there.

Do estimates in three numbers (best case, worst case, plausible case). Don't make promises you can't keep! But try your best. If someone asks you the impossible, say "NO! NO NO NO" as if you were replaying that scene in The Office. Or you can just politely decline and explain why.
